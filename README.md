# pystruct
A Python library for creating and managing different types of data structures. This library was created with the original intent of recreating a maze solving algorithm shown on computerphile. It has since become a library built out of the need to use certain kinds of data structures I was unable to find libraries for. The main one was the graph structure, which is a web of connected nodes, who have properties. This library will not handle matrices and other similar structures, instead it will focus on structures that are used to represent real life structures. 

## Data types
Pystruct will support many data structures and forms. This is a list of structures that are planned to be implemented or already have been, but it is subject to change. 

### Graph
A graph contains nodes and connections. These nodes will have properties. 

### Tree
A tree structure consists of nodes that have a maximum of one parent and any number of children. The nodes also have properties.
